How one could pass the Turing test

Here is my equation.
P = Person
G = Google and the internet
T = Passing the turing test
M = Machine learning algorith

1. G + P ~= T
2. M === P
3. G + M = T

What this proof means is:
1. Person with Google can pass the Turing Test
2. What the person did to pass with google can be replaced with a machine learning algorith. Or the person is equivilent to the machine learning algorith in this case.
3. Google and the intenet when used by a Machine learning algorith passes the Turing test.

One consequence is text based jobs like programming will be able to be done by computers using google and the internet.
Then robots and computer voice enter the picture and you lose the rest of the jobs.

In concoclusion, destress your current job or find another if you can. But think long term, the machine learning algorith hasn't been written yet and robots are still funky at general human stuff.

Once they are all pass the turing test, think of alll those scfi movies where you just can't tell the difference.
